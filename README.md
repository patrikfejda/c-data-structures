# c-data-structures

In this task, we compare 4 different algorithms for efficiently searching
for elements in dynamic sets in terms of the effectiveness of
**insert, delete and search** operations:

1. Balancing algorithm - AVL
1. Balancing algorithm - Red-Black Trees (RBT)
1. Hash table - overflow buckets collision resolution (OB)
1. Hash table - linear probing collision resolution (LP)
